//
//  Maintenance.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  Hourly background tick that prunes rows past their retention age and
//  optionally VACUUMs the SQLite file. Runs on a serial utility queue so
//  it can't fight the sampler or the QueryServer; either side just sees
//  the prune as a normal write while it happens.
//
//  Why hourly: matches the Stats fork's cadence and is plenty given
//  retention is in days. Tightening to minutes would amplify the
//  fixed-cost VACUUM without changing the steady-state DB size.
//
//  Failure model: a prune that errors logs and continues — the next
//  tick retries. We don't pull retention from a mid-prune crash because
//  SQLite's WAL would already have rolled back the failed transaction.
//
