//
//  Privacy.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  Full Disk Access detection and the macOS settings deep-link.
//
//  Burrow shells out to `mo`, which walks system and other-apps' cache
//  directories. On macOS 14+ those reads are TCC-gated ("Burrow would
//  like to access data from other apps") and the prompt is attributed to
//  Burrow — once per protected location, so a single `mo clean --dry-run`
//  or `mo analyze` over the home folder produces a *flood* of dialogs
//  (issue #3).
//
//  The OS-sanctioned remedy is Full Disk Access: once granted, macOS
//  stops gating per-folder reads for this app. We never bypass TCC — we
//  only detect whether we already have access and, if not, point the user
//  at the single switch that grants informed, one-time consent.
