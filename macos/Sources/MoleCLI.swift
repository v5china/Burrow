//
//  MoleCLI.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  Wrapper around the `mo` command. Burrow doesn't ship Mole — it depends
//  on a system-installed copy (`brew install mole`), found via PATH.
//
//  Three commands matter to Burrow today:
//    * `mo status --json` — periodic sampling (SnapshotProducer uses this).
//      Emits the full system snapshot as JSON in ~3 KB. Auto-emits JSON
//      when stdout is not a TTY, but we pass `--json` explicitly so the
//      contract is visible in the args.
//    * `mo clean` / `mo optimize` — CleanView / OptimizeView (streamed).
//    * `mo analyze --json` — Analyze treemap (DiskScanner).
//    * `mo uninstall --list` — Software tab app list (JSON).
//
//  Everything routes through `run(args:)` so subprocess plumbing
//  (timeout, env, NSPipe management) lives in one place.
//
