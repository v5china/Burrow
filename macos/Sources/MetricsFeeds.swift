//
//  The shared metric queries for the two live dashboards (issue #53):
//  the menu-bar HUD (PopupView) and the Status pane both want the latest
//  snapshot and a 30-min sparkline set — so they ask the hub for the SAME
//  keys and get ONE pump each (one timer, one read, two observers). Before
//  this, the HUD ran a 1 s + 20 s timer pair and Status ran a 2 s + 15 s
//  pair, double-polling the same `LiveFeed` snapshot and the same DB
//  history window. Now the popover and the Status pane stop double-polling
//  the moment they bind to these keys.
//
//  The fetch closures live here, once, so the two screens can never drift
//  to slightly-different keys (which would silently un-share the pump).
//  Pure aggregation helpers (`Sparklines.from`) are split out so the
//  manual-clock tests can assert them without a DB.
