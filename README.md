# Burrow

**A free, open-source [mole.fit](https://mole.fit/) — a native macOS GUI for the [Mole](https://github.com/tw93/Mole) CLI (`mo`).**

Burrow wraps the free, open-source `mo` CLI in a native Mac app: clean
junk, manage & uninstall apps, run safe maintenance, map your disk, and
watch live system status — five tools in one window. On top of that it
adds two things the CLI doesn't have: a **long-running history** of your
Mac's metrics in a local SQLite database, and an **MCP server** so Claude
Code can ask "what's been happening on this Mac."

> Burrow is an independent open-source project. It's *inspired by*
> mole.fit's structure and built on the same `mo` engine, but it is **not
> affiliated with or endorsed by mole.fit** — its own name, mark, palette,
> and copy are original.

## The five tools

| Tool | What it does | `mo` command |
|---|---|---|
| **Status** | Live dashboard — health score, CPU, memory, GPU, disk, network, battery with per-metric sparklines, plus a sortable/pinnable process table. | `mo status --json` |
| **Analyze** | Squarified treemap of your disk; drill into any folder, reveal in Finder. | `mo analyze --json` |
| **Software** | Installed-app list with search/sort (size, name, recent, source) and multi-select uninstall; a Homebrew **Updates** tab. | `mo uninstall --list`, `brew outdated` |
| **Clean** | Preview what's reclaimable, then clean for real — categorized cache/log/leftover removal. | `mo clean` |
| **Optimize** | One-tap safe maintenance: rebuild caches, repair metadata, flush DNS, etc. | `mo optimize` |

### Plus, Burrow's own extras

- **Menu-bar HUD** — health hero, metric tiles, top processes, and live
  status of any job running in the app, from the menu bar.
- **History** — long-range charts (5 m → 90 d) over a local SQLite history
  of every metric, plus peak-per-process tables.
- **MCP server** — both a localhost HTTP API and a stdio JSON-RPC server
  (`Burrow --mcp`) so Claude Code can query your Mac's recent state.

## How Burrow compares

|  | **Burrow** | mole.fit | CleanMyMac | Pearcleaner | `mo` / ncdu |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Price | **Free** | $9 once | Subscription | Free | Free |
| Open source | **MIT** | – | – | ✅ | ✅ (`mo`) |
| Signed / notarized | not yet | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | n/a |
| Junk cleanup | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – | ✅ (`mo`) |
| Uninstall + leftovers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ *(focus)* | ✅ (`mo`) |
| Disk treemap | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – | ncdu *(TUI)* |
| Live system monitor | ✅ | ✅ | partial | – | – |
| Long-term metric history | ✅ | – | – | – | – |
| MCP / agent API | ✅ | – | – | – | – |
| GUI | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – *(terminal)* |

Honest notes: **mole.fit** is more polished, signed, and supported — buy it
($9) if you want that and to fund `mo`. **Pearcleaner** is an excellent,
focused open-source uninstaller. **ncdu**/`mo` are terminal tools; Burrow is
the GUI for people who'd rather not live in the shell.

## Requirements

- **macOS 14+**
- **The Mole CLI** — `brew install mole`. Hard requirement; Burrow refuses
  to launch without `mo` on PATH.

## Install

> Burrow is **unsigned** for now (pre-1.0). Each path below clears the
> Gatekeeper quarantine for you. The honest security/trust details — network,
> admin rights, no telemetry — are in **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew install mole                        # required engine
brew install --cask caezium/tap/burrow   # the app (clears quarantine)
```

### Direct download

Download `Burrow-x.y.z.zip` from
[Releases](https://github.com/caezium/Burrow/releases), unzip into
`/Applications`, then:

```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Burrow.app
open /Applications/Burrow.app
```

### Build from source

```bash
brew install xcodegen mole
git clone https://github.com/caezium/Burrow.git && cd Burrow
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project Burrow.xcodeproj -scheme Burrow \
  -configuration Release -destination 'generic/platform=macOS' \
  -derivedDataPath build \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY="" CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
cp -R build/Build/Products/Release/Burrow.app /Applications/
xattr -cr /Applications/Burrow.app
open /Applications/Burrow.app
```

Burrow lives in the menu bar (it's a menu-bar agent). Click the icon →
**Open Burrow**.

## Security & trust

Burrow drives the audited `mo` CLI and adds no surveillance of its own:

- **No telemetry, analytics, accounts, ads, or third-party SDKs**, and no
  backend — nothing to phone home to.
- **No background root helper.** When Clean/Optimize need admin rights,
  macOS's own dialog asks you and Burrow runs that one `mo` command, then
  exits — you approve every elevation.
- **Local-only:** the MCP HTTP server is loopback (`127.0.0.1`, toggle off
  in Settings); history is a local SQLite file. The one opt-in network call
  is `brew outdated` in the Updates tab.
- **Unsigned, pre-1.0** — full honest write-up, including the trade-offs of
  the admin path, in **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.

## Wire it into Claude Code

Burrow doubles as an MCP server. Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "burrow": {
      "command": "/Applications/Burrow.app/Contents/MacOS/Burrow",
      "args": ["--mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code. Tools: `burrow_snapshot`, `burrow_history`,
`burrow_top_processes`, `burrow_info`. There's also a localhost HTTP API
on `127.0.0.1:9277` (`/health`, `/info`, `/snapshot`, `/metrics`).

## Develop & test

```bash
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project Burrow.xcodeproj -scheme Burrow \
  -configuration Debug -destination 'platform=macOS' test
```

38 tests: DB roundtrip + range + stride sampler + prune (10), Store
clamping + defaults (9), Maintenance prune (3), MCP tool routing (7),
squarified treemap invariants (9).

## Architecture

```
mo status --json   ──>  Sampler ──> SQLite (WAL) ──┬─> Status / History (charts)
                                                   ├─> HTTP QueryServer (:9277)
                                                   └─> Burrow --mcp (stdio) ─> Claude Code
mo analyze --json  ──>  DiskScanner + squarified Treemap ──> Analyze
mo clean / optimize ─>  CommandRunner (streamed) ──────────> Clean / Optimize
mo uninstall --list ─>  Software (+ brew outdated for Updates)
```

One binary, two modes: default is the menu-bar GUI; `Burrow --mcp` is the
stdio MCP server (it forks before SwiftUI claims the process). The whole
UI is one translucent window with a top-pill nav (`Brand`/`Tool` design
system); Settings and History are panes in that same window.
