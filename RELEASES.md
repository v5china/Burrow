# Burrow 0.9.1

A quick fix for **Intel Macs**. In 0.9.0 the newly-bundled engine binaries were
built Apple-Silicon-only, so on Intel (x86_64) Macs Burrow could hang at
initialization ([#221](https://github.com/caezium/Burrow/issues/221)). The engine
(`status-go` / `analyze-go`) is now a **universal binary** (arm64 + x86_64) and
runs natively on both architectures. No other changes from 0.9.0.

# Burrow 0.9.0

Burrow's biggest release. It now **bundles its own engine** — no separate `mo`
install — and adds an Activity-Monitor-class **process inspector** with a CPU
watchdog, a **Get Online** connectivity companion, a security-aware **Doctor**,
and smarter Clean, Software, Analyze, and Optimize across the board. Still
local-first, still free.

## Engine
- **Burrow bundles its own engine now.** The app ships an MIT-licensed
  `burrow-engine` (a fork of Mole `mo` at its last MIT release) inside
  `Burrow.app` and runs it directly — so a fresh install needs **no separate
  `brew install mole`**. Burrow prefers the bundled engine, then an installed
  `burrow-engine`, then a legacy system `mo` for existing setups. (#218)

## Process inspector (Status)
- **Per-process inspector** — click any process for a structured panel: identity
  (path, code signature, Mach-O architecture), live CPU/memory, runtime, and the
  process's open network connections.
- **Process tree** — the parent/child hierarchy around any process.
- **CPU watchdog** — set per-process CPU thresholds and get notified when
  something runs hot, with an editor in Settings.
- **Filter, suspend/resume, export** — a typed predicate filter over the process
  table, suspend or resume a process, and export the table.

## Get Online (connectivity companion)
- **On-demand speed test** — measure real down/up throughput.
- **Nearby Wi-Fi scan** — surrounding networks and channel congestion (Home
  mode), so you can pick a clearer channel.
- **Venue captive-portal tips** — venue-specific help for hotel/airport/café
  portals that won't load.
- **Connection history** — a log of connectivity events (SSID changes, drops).

## Doctor (diagnostics)
- **Security posture** — SIP, Gatekeeper, FileVault, and firewall at a glance,
  plus a high-CPU check and one-click **Copy diagnostics**.
- **Battery health** — capacity % and condition (omitted on desktops).
- **More context** — display, external-volume, and network context.

## Clean, Software, Analyze & Optimize
- **Clean** now sorts the review **by reclaimable impact** and **flags sensitive
  paths** (keychain/credential locations) before you delete; the done screen
  shows your **all-time cleaned total**.
- **Software** — App Store updates that need a newer macOS are hidden; ⌘R
  refreshes with a cache bypass; app search is alias-aware.
- **Uninstall** — a Clear-Data-only subset, plus an input-method leftover
  warning.
- **Analyze** — one-tap whole-disk scan, and a treemap "Other" fold for tiny
  entries.
- **Optimize** — a pre-run safety banner when a VPN or external display is
  active.
- **Login items** — modern Login (BTM) items appear in the startup inventory; a
  LaunchAgent on an unplugged drive is no longer flagged broken.
- **Keep Screen On** keeps working with the lid closed.

## Fixed
- **Three main-thread hangs** on the new process/parity surfaces (suspend/resume,
  inspector, tree). (#216)
- A missing `paths:` label on a data-only uninstall plan.

## Windows
- **Windows preview** — version-aligned to 0.9.0; no Windows-specific changes
  this release.

# Burrow 0.8.3

A metrics & menu-bar release: real memory-pressure reporting, a power-draw
widget, pressure-aware coloring everywhere, a live menu-bar preview, two new
runner animations, and a snappier popover. Still local-first.

## Added
- **Power-draw widget.** Live system wattage (W) as a menu-bar metric.
- **Real memory pressure.** "By pressure" now reads actual macOS memory pressure
  — `(wired + compressed) / total` via `host_statistics64`, the same figure
  Activity Monitor reports — instead of reusing the CPU-style utilization ramp.
  Shown as a percentage on the memory tiles, colored green ≤59% / orange 60–79% /
  red ≥80%. (#202)
- **Memory detail card.** The Status dashboard breaks memory down into used /
  free / cached / swap.
- **Live menu-bar preview + layout presets.** Settings previews your *real*
  metrics as you configure them, with one-tap layout presets.
- **Two new runner animations** — Wave and Bars.

## Changed
- **Consistent pressure coloring** across the dashboard tile, popover,
  memory-detail card, and menu bar.
- **Live popover sparklines.** CPU / memory / GPU tick every second (about a
  minute of history).
- **Honest color picker.** "By pressure" is offered only where it applies
  (memory); the temperature color ramp was corrected.

## Fixed
- **Brewfile import/export pickers no longer trip the hang detector** (ANR
  false-positives).
- **App-Hang reports from memory-starved machines are dropped** before sending —
  they were environmental, not Burrow bugs. (#197)

## Performance
- **Snappier popover** — the metric grid no longer re-renders on unrelated state
  changes.

## Windows
- **Windows preview** — a version-aligned 0.8.3 build is attached
  (`BurrowWin-0.8.3-win-x64.zip`). No Windows-specific changes this release.

# Burrow 0.8.2

A fix release: a Full Disk Access grant now actually takes effect, and Burrow
asks for notification permission up front instead of mid-alert. Still
local-first.

## Fixed
- **Full Disk Access is honored again.** The shipped app's embedded framework
  signatures were malformed (`codesign --verify --strict` failed on
  `Sentry.framework`), so macOS couldn't validate Burrow's identity and silently
  ignored a Full Disk Access grant — turning it on in System Settings appeared to
  do nothing. The release now re-signs the app and every nested framework
  inside-out so the signature is valid and the grant takes effect. After
  updating, toggle Full Disk Access off and back on once. (Burrow is still
  ad-hoc-signed, so a re-grant is needed after each update until it ships with a
  Developer ID signature.) (#177)

## Changed
- **Notification permission is requested up front.** Burrow now asks once — when
  you finish onboarding or first enable a notifying feature — instead of
  springing the system prompt the moment a notification tries to fire.

# Burrow 0.8.1

A stability release: the live dashboard no longer freezes, live status now
streams, and there's a one-click Homebrew update button — plus the Windows
preview catches up on its code review. Still local-first.

## Fixed
- **No more "App Hanging" freezes.** The Overview dashboard used to re-render
  its whole grid — every chart tile and the full process table — once a second;
  now only the small Disk / Network tiles update that often, the rest on the
  snapshot. Opening **Settings** and the **About** panel no longer blocks the
  main thread either (login-item status, metrics-folder sizing, and the
  engine-version lookup all moved off it), and **PostHog telemetry now flushes
  off the main thread**.

## Changed
- **Live status streams by default.** With Mole 1.44+, Burrow streams
  `mo status --watch` (newline-delimited JSON) instead of polling `mo status
  --json` — lower latency and less subprocess churn. It falls back to polling
  on older `mo` or if the stream drops, so the dashboard never stalls.

## Added
- **Update with Homebrew** — for cask installs, the update prompt now has a
  one-click button that runs `brew upgrade --cask burrow` and relaunches,
  instead of just printing the command.

## Windows preview
- Closed out the port review: **MCP tool parity with macOS**
  (`burrow_list_apps`, `burrow_purge`, `burrow_installer` — all preview-only
  over MCP), stdio MCP that survives the HTTP toggle, **brand assets / palette /
  fonts / app icon aligned to the Mac**, honest docs, and real MCP +
  deletion-guard test coverage. (Earlier review rounds added Recycle-Bin
  routing, a drive-root guard, and SHA-256 verification of the bundled engine
  binary.) Still an unsigned, build-from-source preview.
