# fetch-sentry.sh — vendor Sentry's prebuilt static xcframework locally.
#
# Sentry is deliberately NOT a Swift Package Manager dependency. SPM eagerly
# downloads EVERY binary xcframework variant in sentry-cocoa's manifest during
# resolution (Sentry, Sentry-Dynamic, -WithARM64e, -WithoutUIKitOrAppKit, …,
# ~500 MB total), and on the GitHub release runner that download hard-hangs
# xcodebuild's SPM forever — even though `curl` pulls the same artifact in under
# a second. So we vendor only the single static Sentry.xcframework we actually
# link (the same one the old SPM `Sentry` product used), with a checksum-pinned
# curl that retries on transient TLS failures. macos/project.yml references it
# as a local framework; CrashReporter.swift is unchanged.
#
# Idempotent: a stamp file lets repeat builds skip the download.
