//
//  MoEngine.swift
//  Burrow
//
//  The single entry point to the `mo` runners (issue #48). Burrow grew several
//  process shapes — capture (small one-shot commands), streaming (clean /
//  optimize), and interactive PTY (purge / installer) — each found and spawned
//  at its own call site. `MoEngine` is the ONE facade callers reach for so
//  "how do I run mo?" has a single answer.
//
//  Three shapes hang off the facade as methods — CAPTURE, DISCOVERY, and
//  interactive PTY — each delegating to the existing, tested port; the facade
//  does NOT reimplement any spawn or PTY internals. STREAMING is reached
//  through the EXPOSED `streamPort` (not a wrapper method): `OperationFlow`
//  holds the `any ProcessPort` to drive its own reduce/notify/auth-cancel loop,
//  so the facade hands it the production port rather than the stream. The
//  one-shot ELEVATED path is NOT on the facade — it stays in
//  `MoleCLI.runElevatedClassified` (trusted-location resolution + the shared
//  `PrivilegeBroker`), the path production has always used.
//
//  Behavior is preserved exactly: a `capture(_:)` call produces the same argv,
//  stdin, environment, timeout, and result fields that `MoleCLI.run` did, and
//  `interactive()` vends a FRESH `PTYTask` whose raw, escape-preserving output
//  the `SelectionSession` reducer depends on. The ports are injected
//  (production defaults are the real ones) so every shape is testable with
//  scripted fakes, matching the seams `MoleCLI`/`MoleProcess`/`ProcessPort`/
//  `PTYPort` already expose.
